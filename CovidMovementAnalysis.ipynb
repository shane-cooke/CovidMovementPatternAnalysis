    "## Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "In Ireland, Parks, Residential, and Grocery and Pharmacy had the highest rates of movement, and Retail and Recreation, Transit Stations and Workplaces had the lowest rates of movement. I believe this to mostly be down to COVID-19 and the restrictions put in place by the Irish Government. Parks had a massive spike of up to ~+180% between July and September which none of the other sectors replicated even nearly. I believe this to be partially weather correlated but also largely due to the COVID-19 restrictions that the Irish Government put in place during this time period (discussed in more detail later in my analysis). Grocery and Pharmacy were classed as 'essential businesses' by the Irish Government which means their doors never shut during the duration of this year. I believe this to be the main reason that it had much higher movement than a lot of the other sectors. One big reason residential had such high movement patterns throughout the year is because of the closure of non-essential businesses, meaning that many people had to work from home. Lots of people chose to cocoon as well which contributed massively.\n",
    "In my opinion, the reason that the Retail and Recreation sector had very low movement throughout the timeframe was due to the strict restrictions on indoor gatherings and events. Very limited numbers of people could congregate indoors and for a large part of the year, much of this sector was shut down. Workplaces were also shutdown for a long period which had a huge impact on transit stations making both sectors reach lows of ~-65% and ~-75% respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Italy saw the same huge spike in movement in parks, which again I largely put down to summer weather and COVID-19 restrictions on indoor meeting places. Residential movement increased quite drastically by ~+30% for the period of the lockdown, but this quickly declined back to a relatively straight line along 0% from June onwards. Retail and Recreation, Workplaces, Transit Stations, and Grocery and Pharmacy all followed the same rough shape on the line graph, with a massive dip during lockdown between March and June. From June onwards, all of these sectors settled in a relatively straight line between ~-5% and ~-20%. The reason they all follow the same rough shape is because once lockdown ended in Italy restrictions where released extremely fast and all sectors where allowed to re-open. There is a notable drop of about ~-15% in the Workplaces sector during August, which is due to the fact that the vast majority of Italians take their summer vacation during this time period.\n",
    "\n",
    "New Zealand was very much different to Ireland and Italy in that the Parks sector followed the same rough line as all of the other sectors bar Residential. I believe this to largely be down to the extremely strict and vigorous lockdown rules imposed by the New Zealand Government. Grocery and Pharmacy suffered the least over the time period reaching a low point of ~-40% due to it being essential, while some other non-essential sectors like Retail and Recreation reached lows of over ~-90%. Residential followed an inverse curve to the rest of the sectors which is to be expected. As restrictions got stricter and all non-essential businesses began to close, people of course began to work from home and cocoon. New Zealand entered a second lockdown between August and September which is easily visible on the graph by the rapid increase in residential movement, and rapid drop in all other forms of movement.\n",

    "The most obvious trend in all three countries is the massive drop in overall movement between the end of March and the middle of May. This is of course due to COVID-19 lockdowns. New Zealand and Italy both had more strict and severe lockdowns than Ireland, which is reflected in the movement patterns during this time period. Ireland never reached the overall lows of ~-55% movement that Italy and New Zealand reached, with ~-40% being its lowest point. During this time period, Ireland had greater movement than the other two countries in every sector, with parks even going above the baseline 0% at certain points. In all three countries, the only sector that had increased movement during this period was residential. A ~+30% increase was observed in each country between late March and mid May. As I have stated previosuly, I suspect that this is due to the number of people who where forced to work at home for the duration of the lockdown, because as soon as lockdowns lifted in the beginning of May the residential numbers dropped almost 25% across the all countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "From mid May onwards, all three countries overall movement began to rise at a similiar rate until mid June. New Zealands overall movement plateuad from mid June until the beginning of August, whereas both Italy and Irelands movements continued to rise rather rapidly. At the beginning of August, New Zealands overall movement sat at ~-10% while Italy and Ireland's movement reached heights of ~+9% and ~+4% respectively. This is because New Zealand, even though they came out of lockdown, kept strict and definite rules and released restrictions very slowly. Ireland and Italy however, came out of lockdown much more rapidly, and released restrictions on a much faster basis than New Zealand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Between the beginning of August and the beginning of September, New Zealand had a drop of a further ~-15% overall movement, leaving them at ~-25%. This is because New Zealand began a new lockdown due to a growing cluster of around 29 cases. Italy and Ireland did not have a lockdown at this time which is reflected in the overall total movement graph. During this same time period Italy's overall movement continued to rapidly rise to ~+15%, which is down to a continual releasing of restrictions by the Italian government, and a relatively static case growth. Ireland had a drop from ~+5% overall movement to ~-5% during this same time period. While this drop seems significant, I don't believe it to be wholly due to COVID, which I will discuss further, in the next paragraph.\n",
    "\n",
    "In mid September, both Italy and Ireland had an overall movement drop of ~-8% and ~-12% respectively. While this seems significant, upon further inspection, all sectors stayed relatively consistent except for parks. In both Italy and Ireland parks had a drop of ~-140% and ~-60% movement respectively. In Ireland, this is partially down to weather in my opinion, as winter begins to set in and temperatures begin to drop, parks become less and less viable as a place for recreation. However, in both Italy and Ireland, I believe it to also be a result of a low growth of COVID cases, which meant that people where more willing to congregate indoors. \n",
    "In New Zealand, parks never reached above 0% change in baseline movement, and continued on a very slow growth path since the first lockdown. This is evident in the total movement graph, where you can see that New Zealand has no rapid drop in mid September like Italy and Ireland do. I believe this to be a result of New Zealands strict lockdown rules, and the New Zealand public's adherence to these rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "By looking at the correlation bar charts, it is clear to see how the countries movement patterns compare to eachother. The Residential sector in Ireland and Italy proved to be the most correlated with one another and the Parks sector in Ireland and New Zealand proved to be the least correlated with one another. In all but one sector, Ireland's movement patterns were most correlated with Italy's movement patterns, however Ireland's Transit Stations were most correlated with New Zealand's Transit Stations.\n",
    "In Retail and Recreation, Parks, and Workplaces, Ireland and New Zealand were the least correlated with one another and in Grocery and Pharmacy, Transit Stations, and Residential, Italy and New Zealand were the least correlated with one another.\n",
    "\n",
    "I provided the table below in order to see the most/least correlated sectors more clearly:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Most Correlated:                                       \n",
    "- ***Retail and Recreation*** : Ireland and Italy\n",
    "- ***Grocery and Pharmacy***  : Ireland and Italy\n",
    "- ***Parks***                 : Ireland and Italy\n",
    "- ***Transit Stations***      : Ireland and New Zealand\n",
    "- ***Workplaces***            : Ireland and Italy\n",
    "- ***Residential***           : Ireland and Italy\n",
    "\n",
    "### Least Correlated:\n",
    "- ***Retail and Recreation*** : Ireland and New Zealand\n",
    "- ***Grocery and Pharmacy***  : Italy and New Zealand\n",
    "- ***Parks***                 : Ireland and New Zealand\n",
    "- ***Transit Stations***      : Italy and New Zealand\n",
    "- ***Workplaces***            : Ireland and New Zealand\n",
    "- ***Residential***           : Italy and New Zealand\n",
    "\n",
    "Through both the table above and the total correlation bar chart, it is clear to see that Ireland and Italy had the highest total correlation with a value of 0.746500. It is also clear to see that Italy and New Zealand had the lowest total correlation with a value of 0.625431.\n",
    "\n",
    "In my opinion, the reasons for Ireland and Italy being the most correlated are down to geographical similarities, cultural similarities, similiar approaches to lockdown and restrictions, and a similiar levels of public obedience to these restrictions. \n",
    "The reasons I belive Italy and New Zealand to be the least correlated are geographical differences, cultural differences, much different approaches to lockdowns and restrictions, and a much different level of public obdeience to these restrictions."
